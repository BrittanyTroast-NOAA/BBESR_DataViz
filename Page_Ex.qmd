# Introduction

## Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and Ecosystem Based Management

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Integrated
Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) is a comprehensive approach to the analysis
and synthesis of existing data to facilitate Ecosystem-Based Management
(EBM). This approach integrates all components of an ecosystem,
including humans, into the decision-making process so that managers can
balance trade-offs and determine what is more likely to achieve their
desired goals. The approach is a NOAA-wide initiative that provides a
consistent national framework but is flexible enough to accommodate
regional needs. Intending to support Ecosystem-Based Management, the
NOAA's Gulf of Mexico Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program seeks to
provide scientific knowledge of the Barataria Basin integrated ecosystem
and transfer that knowledge to scientists and managers. The purpose of
this report is to provide a broad-level overview of the current state of
the Barataria Basin concerning its natural variability and recent and
historical trends. This Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) summarizes trends
in existing datasets already available within the Barataria Basin. We
did not collect nor present new data, did not conduct multivariate
analyses on the suite of indicators, or synthesized our findings to
report on the overall conditions for the complex ecosystem of the
Barataria Basin.

![The Barataria Basin study area.](images/2_2-1.png){#fig-studyarea}

## Characterizing the Barataria Basin

The Barataria Basin (Hydrologic Unit Code 08090301, i.e., East Central
Louisiana Coastal) is an abandoned deltaic interdistributary estuarine
system between the Mississippi River's levees and Bayou Lafourche. The
basin is roughly triangular, with its northernmost point at
Donaldsonville, LA. It is about 110 km long and 50 km wide at its
largest point, where it meets the Gulf of Mexico. The Barataria Basin
contains wetlands and bays and is bounded to the south by a series of
barrier islands (Conner & Day, 1987). From 1932 to 2016, the Barataria
Basin lost approximately 1,100 km2 of wetlands to open water due to
saltwater intrusion, sea level rise, subsidence, and coastal erosion
(Couvillion et al., 2017). The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in 2010
exacerbated shoreline erosion by degrading oiled salt marshes in
Barataria Basin (DWH NRDA Trustees, 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Beland et
al., 2017).

The Barataria Basin is an area of approximately 9228 km2 and consists of
nine parishes (i.e., territorial divisions of local government
equivalent to counties in other states). For this Ecosystem Status
Report, our study area contains only those portions of Lafourche (2266.8
km2), Plaquemines (4012.3 km2), Jefferson (1288 km2), and St. Charles
Parishes (743 km2; @fig-studyarea) that lie within the basin boundaries.
These four parishes make up 90% of the area within the basin. These four
parishes also represent 81% of the Barataria Basin population,
approximately 370,000 residents. For many indicators, we examined the
four parishes in their entirety, even if a portion of the parish lies
outside of the Barataria Basin boundary. To gain a more nuanced
understanding of the human dimensions of Barataria Basin, we combined
the county/parish scale with the community or Census Designated Places
(CDP) spatial boundary (@fig-community). In the Human Dimension section
(Section 7), we also used the U.S. Census block-group and Census tract
spatial-level data to discuss changes in total population,map population
density, racial distribution, and other related data.Our goal was to use
the finest available spatial resolution, provide the most extensive time
series possible, and give the most detail on a topic.

![Barataria Basin's Communities. Note: Communities are defined using
Census Designated Places, a US Census geographic
category.](images/2_2-2.png){#fig-community}

## Conceptual Socio-Ecological Model of the Barataria Basin Ecosystem

NOAA's Gulf of Mexico Integrated Ecosystem Assessment program worked
with local experts to create a socio-ecological conceptual model of the
Barataria Basin. This model identified relevant indicators to assess the
baseline ecosystem condition and better understand the potential
consequences of ecosystem-scale restoration activity in coastal
Louisiana (@fig-dpser). In addition, we worked with a team of social
scientists with expertise in the human dimensions of Southern Louisiana
to develop a Results Chain (Margoluis et al. 2013) that further
identified variables that are of specific importance to the
socio-economic well-being of the Barataria Basin residents. These
ecological and human dimension indicators are used in an ecosystem
assessment of the Barataria Basin to establish a baseline and evaluate
the status, natural variability, and longterm trends of the basin before
the construction and operation of large-scale restoration projects.

We modified the EBM DPSER Model (Kelble et al. 2013) to categorize
crucial ecosystem components such as drivers, pressures, states, human
activities/ecosystem services, human dimensions, and management
responses/restoration activities (see Appendix B). It is important to
note that some indicators could fit into multiple categories, however,
indicators were placed in the most appropriate indicator for the region
and ESR objectives.

![Conceptual socio-ecological model of the Barataria Basin Ecosystem.](images/2_3-1.jpg){#fig-dpser}

## Indicator Selection

We selected biophysical and ecological indicators from an extensive list
of potential variables based on three criteria: (1) data availability,
(2) responsiveness to change, and (3) utility to managers and
stakeholders. First, for each indicator, consistent, credible data must
be available in a long-term time series (at least ten years). Second,
the indicator needs to be able to respond to or drive change in the
ecosystem. Finally, the indicator needs to be understood by managers and
a wide range of stakeholders to be considered relevant.

The main criterion for selecting Human Dimension indicators was the
utility to stakeholders; more precisely, selections of indicators and
variables occurred despite data availability for at least ten
consecutive years. Human dimension data is collected every five or ten
years and often consists of five or fewer data points. We considered it
essential to explore human dimension data to offer a comprehensive
overview of the ecosystem. Where available, we used time-series data,
but single data collections offer insight at different spatial scales
and provide a baseline understanding of the status of the Barataria
Basin. The Human Dimension data available to assess the human dimensions
in the Barataria Basin comes primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau or
the American Community Survey estimates. Indicators designed for market
research, such as the Qualityof- Life Indicators created by AGS Inc
(2016), were often used in this analysis to provide additional insights.
In addition, we utilized the fisheries social vulnerability indicators
developed by the NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology (2019)
to discuss various social vulnerability aspects specific to Barataria
Basin's coastal communities (Appendix C).

## Notes on Interpreting Time Series Figures

Plots of time series data are in a standardized format for
straightforward interpretation (e.g., @fig-timeseries). The x-axis
represents the temporal dimension, which may be monthly or yearly time
steps, and the y-axis represents the indicator value in units specified
in the axis label. The dashed horizontal line represents the mean
indicator value across the entire time series, and the solid horizontal
lines denote the mean plus or minus one standard deviation. Red-shaded
and green-shaded areas show years when the indicator value is below or
above one standard deviation from the mean. The blue vertical shaded box
highlights the last five years of indicator values where trend analysis
occurs. Black circles to the right of each figure denote whether the
indicator values over the last five years are greater than (plus sign),
less than (minus sign), or within (solid circle) one standard deviation
from the mean of the overall time series. Arrows to the right of each
figure indicate whether the least squares linear fit through the last
five years of data produces a positive or negative slope greater than
one standard deviation (upward or downward arrows, respectively) or less
than one standard deviation (left-right arrow). Multi-panel plots show
trends in the same indicator, calculated for different categories or
over varying spatial domains.

![Example time series plot, showing an indicator plotted with its mean and standard
deviation and trend analysis for the five most recent years of data. See](images/2_5-1.jpg){#fig-timeseries}

# Drivers
## Precipitation

There are periods of relatively high and low precipitation; however, recent trend analysis reveals values within
one standard deviation from the mean with an increasing trend in the slope (@fig-precip).

```


## Air Temperature

Minimum, mean, and maximum air temperatures were analyzed from 1900 through 2018 for Climate Division
9 in southeast Louisiana (@fig-airtemps). In recent years, minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures have
values greater than one standard deviation from the mean, with slopes within one standard deviation. These
results show that all three metrics of air temperatures have been increasing compared to historical years.

# Pressures

## Nuisance Aquatic Vegetation
When non-native species crowd out native species, they become invasive species. The USGS Nonindigenous
Aquatic Species (2019) database lists 36 invasive plant and animal species found within Barataria
Basin that negatively impact this ecosystem. Floating aquatic plants like giant salvinia, water hyacinth, and
alligator weed clog many public waterways. These plants grow fast, making boat access difficult. They compete
for space, nutrients, and light with native floating water plants like water lilies and duckweed and change the
kinds of food available for wildlife and for humans who fish or hunt in the Barataria Basin. LDWF’s Aquatic
Plant Control program removes nuisance aquatic plants from public waterways through various means, such as
aquatic herbicides, mechanical methods, and biological control agents (LDWF 2019a). Spring 2019 estimates
of nuisance aquatic vegetation in public waterways within the Barataria Basin totaled approximately 37,250
acres (i.e., 22,000 acres of water hyacinth; 6,500 acres of giant salvinia; 3,500 acres of Eurasian watermilfoil;
2,000 acres of common salvinia; 2,000 acres of alligator weed and 1,250 acres of hydrilla). Trend analysis
from the last five years of data reveals that the estimated acreage of nuisance aquatic vegetation in public
waterways was within one standard deviation from the mean with no trends in slope. However, a significant
drop occurred in 2008 (@fig-nav).

#| fig-cap: !expr fig_caps$cap[fig_caps$ind=="nav"]

ggplotly(plot_fn_obj_doc(readRDS("Data_Obj/nav_li.rds")))
```

## Oil Spills
With a large amount of oil exploration, production, and transportation (via pipelines and tankers) within
Louisiana, oil spills are a common environmental issue. The Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office (LOSCO)
website reports that the average volume of oil spilled annually in Louisiana is approximately 330,000 gallons,
representing around 20% of the total oil spilled in the United States (LOSCO).

In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill damaged 120 kilometers of shoreline marshes within Barataria
Bay (Michels et al. 2013; Nixon et al. 2016). The United States Coast Guard’s (USCG)
National Response Center serves as an emergency call center that receives initial reports for oil spills and
forwards that information to appropriate federal/state agencies for response (@fig-oilsp). We analyzed the
number of oil spill reports from 1990 through 2017. Generally, reports appear to be declining, and recent
trend analysis reveals values less than one standard deviation from the mean with a decreasing trend.

```

# States
## Red Drum
Red drum are a highly targeted sportfish in coastal Louisiana. We examined the catch per unit effort (CPUE)
of red drum from gill, seine, and trammel nets from 1985-2022. Red drum have several CPUE spikes above
one standard deviation from the mean; however, they are within that range over the last five years for all
gear types. Seine net catches show an increasing trend in the slope and catches from trammel and gill nets
exhibited no trend in recent years (@fig-rdrum).
```{r}
#| label: fig-rdrum
#| fig-cap: !expr fig_caps$cap[fig_caps$ind=="rdrum"]

ggplotly(plot_fn_obj_doc(readRDS("Data_Obj/rdrum_li.rds")))
```

## Brown Pelican
The Brown Pelican is the state bird of Louisiana. It was federally listed as endangered throughout its United
States range in 1970 and later removed from the list in 2009 due to the dramatic population recovery. In 1971
LDWF reestablished Brown Pelicans in Louisiana. Birds were translocated from Florida colonies and established
on Queen Bess Island in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Since then, LDWF has conducted annual aerial surveys of
Brown Pelican colonies along Louisiana’s coast and counted nests (Selman et al. 2016). The population of
Brown Pelicans on Queen Bess has been increasing slowly and steadily until 1990 when years of erosion
caused a decrease in available nesting habitat (@fig-brpeli). In the early 1990s, the State of Louisiana
restored Queen Bess Island’s shoreline and critical waterbird nesting habitat. After that restoration, the Brown
Pelican colony grew steadily, with occasional setbacks in 2000 and 2005 due to wind-driven high tides and
storm surges from strong hurricanes. The Brown Pelican colony on Queen Bess Island has bounced back again
after these perturbations, so much so that the mean number of nests was greater than one standard deviation
above the long-term mean in the last five years of data (2005-2010). Queen Bess Island underwent restoration
again, which finished in February 2020; this time, the restoration was funded under DWH NRDA by the LA TIG.

```

# Human Activities
## Blue Crab Catch
Blue crab catch shows no change in the last five years, while revenue has increased, primarily due to a price
spike in 2013 (@fig-blcrab). The declines due to Deepwater Horizon in 2010 are also apparent. Price here is
determined mainly by national demand, as much of the blue crab catch is exported to supplement fisheries in
other regions such as Maryland and New York (Yglesias, 2013). Longerterm trends depict a slight decrease in the
catch while revenue has risen, suggesting nationally high prices may be putting increased pressure on the local 
blue crab stock.

#| label: fig-blcrab
#| fig-cap: !expr fig_caps$cap[fig_caps$ind=="blcrab"]

ggplotly(plot_fn_obj_doc(readRDS("Data_Obj/blcrab_li.rds")))
```

## Oyster Catch
Oyster catch has remained stable in the last five years while revenues increased (@fig-oystercat). Both catch and
revenue dropped in 2010 due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but catch, and revenue rebounded to pre-spill
levels quickly. The revenue increases likely result from a price increase associated with increased demand for
oyster products in restaurants (Seafood Source, 2014).

#| fig-cap: !expr fig_caps$cap[fig_caps$ind=="oystercat"]

ggplotly(plot_fn_obj_doc(readRDS("Data_Obj/oystercat_li.rds")))
```

## Seafood Dealers & Vessels Fishing
The number of vessels and dealers reporting catches from Barataria Basin and the number of people involved
in the seafood industry has remained relatively stable, with some annual fluctuations, since 2005. Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita caused a decline in the region immediately after 2005, but overall levels of participation
appear to have stabilized (@fig-vesfish). Most fishermen have a set of fishing routes close to their home or
working waterfront and established relationships with seafood dealers who buy their catch, so a small-scale
approach can be necessary for looking at the fishing industry’s well-being. The LA Trip Ticket program collected
the data used for this analysis, as provided by NMFS Commercial Fisheries Statistics Program.

```

# Human Dimensions
## Percent Small Business
Self-employment and small mom-and-pop types of businesses are common in Barataria Basin (@fig-persmbusi).
Small businesses of this type provide a sense of independence and self-governance, which supersede the
economic benefits and stability that steady, formal employment would provide. It is also a lifestyle that builds
much of the social fabric in these communities. Many small businesses exist to provide much-needed services
for the specialized economic activities in the Basin (Social Science Advisory Team 2018 - meeting notes).

#| label: fig-persmbusi
#| fig-cap: !expr fig_caps$cap[fig_caps$ind=="persmbusi"]

ggplotly(plot_fn_obj_doc(readRDS("Data_Obj/persmbusi_li.rds")))
```

## Unemployment
The unemployment rate across the Barataria parishes peaked in the early 1990s and 2010 and, more
recently, in 2020. Lafourche Parish has had some extreme fluctuations in unemployment. All four parishes
are experiencing a sharp increase in unemployment from 2019 to 2020 and a return to lower levels in the
following year (@fig-unemploy). The steep increases in unemployment in 2020 are related to the impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic on the service sector. Overall, unemployment trends in Jefferson and Saint Charles
Parishes show that unemployment has increased in recent years and is stable in Plaquemines and Lafourche.
In 2022, Louisiana had an unemployment rate of 3.2%, and the U.S. had an unemployment rate of 3.7%,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Barataria Basin parishes, like Jefferson and Lafourche, have
significantly higher unemployment rates than the state and national averages.
