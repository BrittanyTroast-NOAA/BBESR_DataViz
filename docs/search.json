    "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) is a comprehensive approach to the analysis and synthesis of existing data to facilitate Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM). This approach integrates all components of an ecosystem, including humans, into the decision-making process so that managers can balance trade-offs and determine what is more likely to achieve their desired goals. The approach is a NOAA-wide initiative that provides a consistent national framework but is flexible enough to accommodate regional needs. Intending to support Ecosystem-Based Management, the NOAA’s Gulf of Mexico Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program seeks to provide scientific knowledge of the Barataria Basin integrated ecosystem and transfer that knowledge to scientists and managers. The purpose of this report is to provide a broad-level overview of the current state of the Barataria Basin concerning its natural variability and recent and historical trends. This Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) summarizes trends in existing datasets already available within the Barataria Basin. We did not collect nor present new data, did not conduct multivariate analyses on the suite of indicators, or synthesized our findings to report on the overall conditions for the complex ecosystem of the Barataria Basin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Barataria Basin study area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Barataria Basin (Hydrologic Unit Code 08090301, i.e., East Central Louisiana Coastal) is an abandoned deltaic interdistributary estuarine system between the Mississippi River’s levees and Bayou Lafourche. The basin is roughly triangular, with its northernmost point at Donaldsonville, LA. It is about 110 km long and 50 km wide at its largest point, where it meets the Gulf of Mexico. The Barataria Basin contains wetlands and bays and is bounded to the south by a series of barrier islands (Conner & Day, 1987). From 1932 to 2016, the Barataria Basin lost approximately 1,100 km2 of wetlands to open water due to saltwater intrusion, sea level rise, subsidence, and coastal erosion (Couvillion et al., 2017). The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in 2010 exacerbated shoreline erosion by degrading oiled salt marshes in Barataria Basin (DWH NRDA Trustees, 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Beland et al., 2017).\nThe Barataria Basin is an area of approximately 9228 km2 and consists of nine parishes (i.e., territorial divisions of local government equivalent to counties in other states). For this Ecosystem Status Report, our study area contains only those portions of Lafourche (2266.8 km2), Plaquemines (4012.3 km2), Jefferson (1288 km2), and St. Charles Parishes (743 km2; Figure 1) that lie within the basin boundaries. These four parishes make up 90% of the area within the basin. These four parishes also represent 81% of the Barataria Basin population, approximately 370,000 residents. For many indicators, we examined the four parishes in their entirety, even if a portion of the parish lies outside of the Barataria Basin boundary. To gain a more nuanced understanding of the human dimensions of Barataria Basin, we combined the county/parish scale with the community or Census Designated Places (CDP) spatial boundary (Figure 2). In the Human Dimension section (Section 7), we also used the U.S. Census block-group and Census tract spatial-level data to discuss changes in total population,map population density, racial distribution, and other related data.Our goal was to use the finest available spatial resolution, provide the most extensive time series possible, and give the most detail on a topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Barataria Basin’s Communities. Note: Communities are defined using Census Designated Places, a US Census geographic category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOAA’s Gulf of Mexico Integrated Ecosystem Assessment program worked with local experts to create a socio-ecological conceptual model of the Barataria Basin. This model identified relevant indicators to assess the baseline ecosystem condition and better understand the potential consequences of ecosystem-scale restoration activity in coastal Louisiana (Figure 3). In addition, we worked with a team of social scientists with expertise in the human dimensions of Southern Louisiana to develop a Results Chain (Margoluis et al. 2013) that further identified variables that are of specific importance to the socio-economic well-being of the Barataria Basin residents. These ecological and human dimension indicators are used in an ecosystem assessment of the Barataria Basin to establish a baseline and evaluate the status, natural variability, and longterm trends of the basin before the construction and operation of large-scale restoration projects.\nWe modified the EBM DPSER Model (Kelble et al. 2013) to categorize crucial ecosystem components such as drivers, pressures, states, human activities/ecosystem services, human dimensions, and management responses/restoration activities (see Appendix B). It is important to note that some indicators could fit into multiple categories, however, indicators were placed in the most appropriate indicator for the region and ESR objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Conceptual socio-ecological model of the Barataria Basin Ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe selected biophysical and ecological indicators from an extensive list of potential variables based on three criteria: (1) data availability, (2) responsiveness to change, and (3) utility to managers and stakeholders. First, for each indicator, consistent, credible data must be available in a long-term time series (at least ten years). Second, the indicator needs to be able to respond to or drive change in the ecosystem. Finally, the indicator needs to be understood by managers and a wide range of stakeholders to be considered relevant.\nThe main criterion for selecting Human Dimension indicators was the utility to stakeholders; more precisely, selections of indicators and variables occurred despite data availability for at least ten consecutive years. Human dimension data is collected every five or ten years and often consists of five or fewer data points. We considered it essential to explore human dimension data to offer a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem. Where available, we used time-series data, but single data collections offer insight at different spatial scales and provide a baseline understanding of the status of the Barataria Basin. The Human Dimension data available to assess the human dimensions in the Barataria Basin comes primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau or the American Community Survey estimates. Indicators designed for market research, such as the Qualityof- Life Indicators created by AGS Inc (2016), were often used in this analysis to provide additional insights. In addition, we utilized the fisheries social vulnerability indicators developed by the NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology (2019) to discuss various social vulnerability aspects specific to Barataria Basin’s coastal communities (Appendix C).\n\n\n\nPlots of time series data are in a standardized format for straightforward interpretation (e.g., Figure 4). The x-axis represents the temporal dimension, which may be monthly or yearly time steps, and the y-axis represents the indicator value in units specified in the axis label. The dashed horizontal line represents the mean indicator value across the entire time series, and the solid horizontal lines denote the mean plus or minus one standard deviation. Red-shaded and green-shaded areas show years when the indicator value is below or above one standard deviation from the mean. The blue vertical shaded box highlights the last five years of indicator values where trend analysis occurs. Black circles to the right of each figure denote whether the indicator values over the last five years are greater than (plus sign), less than (minus sign), or within (solid circle) one standard deviation from the mean of the overall time series. Arrows to the right of each figure indicate whether the least squares linear fit through the last five years of data produces a positive or negative slope greater than one standard deviation (upward or downward arrows, respectively) or less than one standard deviation (left-right arrow). Multi-panel plots show trends in the same indicator, calculated for different categories or over varying spatial domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example time series plot, showing an indicator plotted with its mean and standard deviation and trend analysis for the five most recent years of data.

The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (2019) database lists 36 invasive plant and animal species found within Barataria Basin that negatively impact this ecosystem. Floating aquatic plants like giant salvinia, water hyacinth, and alligator weed clog many public waterways. These plants grow fast, making boat access difficult. They compete for space, nutrients, and light with native floating water plants like water lilies and duckweed and change the kinds of food available for wildlife and for humans who fish or hunt in the Barataria Basin. LDWF’s Aquatic Plant Control program removes nuisance aquatic plants from public waterways through various means, such as aquatic herbicides, mechanical methods, and biological control agents (LDWF 2019a). Spring 2019 estimates of nuisance aquatic vegetation in public waterways within the Barataria Basin totaled approximately 37,250 acres (i.e., 22,000 acres of water hyacinth; 6,500 acres of giant salvinia; 3,500 acres of Eurasian watermilfoil; 2,000 acres of common salvinia; 2,000 acres of alligator weed and 1,250 acres of hydrilla). Trend analysis from the last five years of data reveals that the estimated acreage of nuisance aquatic vegetation in public waterways was within one standard deviation from the mean with no trends in slope. However, a significant drop occurred in 2008 (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Nuisance aquatic vegetation (thousands of acres) in waterways within Barataria Basin from 2006 to 2019 (Source: USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species 2019)."

The United States Coast Guard’s (USCG) National Response Center serves as an emergency call center that receives initial reports for oil spills and forwards that information to appropriate federal/state agencies for response (Figure 8).

    "text": "Brown Pelican\nThe Brown Pelican is the state bird of Louisiana. It was federally listed as endangered throughout its United States range in 1970 and later removed from the list in 2009 due to the dramatic population recovery. In 1971 LDWF reestablished Brown Pelicans in Louisiana. Birds were translocated from Florida colonies and established on Queen Bess Island in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Since then, LDWF has conducted annual aerial surveys of Brown Pelican colonies along Louisiana’s coast and counted nests (Selman et al. 2016). The population of Brown Pelicans on Queen Bess has been increasing slowly and steadily until 1990 when years of erosion caused a decrease in available nesting habitat (Figure 10). In the early 1990s, the State of Louisiana restored Queen Bess Island’s shoreline and critical waterbird nesting habitat. After that restoration, the Brown Pelican colony grew steadily, with occasional setbacks in 2000 and 2005 due to wind-driven high tides and storm surges from strong hurricanes. The Brown Pelican colony on Queen Bess Island has bounced back again after these perturbations, so much so that the mean number of nests was greater than one standard deviation above the long-term mean in the last five years of data (2005-2010). Queen Bess Island underwent restoration again, which finished in February 2020; this time, the restoration was funded under DWH NRDA by the LA TIG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Number of Brown Pelican nests on Queen Bess Island, LA, from 1971 to 2010 (Source: LDWF, Selman et al. 2016)."
